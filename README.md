# NN-course-labs
My laboratory works from the neural networks course at the Institute


## Notebooks
* Lab 1 - multiclass classification with PyTorch
* Lab 2 - multiclass classification with CNN and RNN
* Lab 3 - text generation with RNN
* Lab 4 - cyberbullying detection and classification
  
  Features:
  * metaheuristic for hyperparameters tuning
  * models ensemble

The deployment code of the model from lab 4 can be found [here](https://github.com/AcipenserSturio/iad-project/tree/NN_with_new_interface)
